Test notes for TCP/UDP socket connection
----------------------------------------

Help and arguments for tester applications socket_client.py and socket_server.py can be seen with -h or --help:
    $ python socket_server.py -h
    $ python socket_server.py --help


=== Transmit and Receive flowgraph on a virtual channel.

Before performing this test, please verify protocol and port numbers in server test app, flowgraph and client test app.

1. In a terminal, start the socket server app,
    $ python socket_server.py -P udp -p 50008

2. In GNU Radio Companion, start ev_tx_rx_socket.grc.

3. In another terminal, start sock client app, 
     python socket_client.py -P udp -p 50007

4. In terminal opened in step 1, you should see something like:
  SERVER, received message: CLIENT, sending message 8
  SERVER, received message: CLIENT, sending message 9


=== Socket sender test

Socket server in flowgraph, socket client in app.

1. In GNU Radio Companion, start socket_server.grc.

2. In a terminal, start socket client app, 
    $ python socket_client.py -P udp -p 50007

3. In the terminal, you should see something like:
  SERVER, received message: Socket Sender message in event payload
  SERVER, received message: Socket Sender message in event payload


=== Socket receiver test

1. In a terminal, start socket server app,
    $ python socket_server.py -P udp -p 50008

2. In GNU Radio Companion, start socket_client.grc.

3. In the terminal, you should see something like:
  SERVER, received message: Socket Sender message in event payload
  SERVER, received message: Socket Sender message in event payload


=== Sock sender and receiver test only with apps:
In the case of UDP order of steps 1 and 2 is irrelevant.

1. In a terminal, start socket server app,
    $ python sock_server.py -P udp -p 50008

2. In a terminal, start socket client app, 
    $ python socket_client.py -P udp -p 50007

3. In terminal 1 you should see something like:
    SERVER, received message: CLIENT, sending message 8
    SERVER, received message: CLIENT, sending message 9
